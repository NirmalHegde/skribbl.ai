# Skribbl.AI
Currently developing a variant to skribbl.io where rather than using a mouse to play the drawing game, you would instead use your finger and webcam to draw. The front-end is being developed using React and the back-end is being developed using Express and Node. FTP requests are being made using socket.io.

## How to start

1. Use `npm install` in both the client directory as well as the server directory
2. Use `npm start` in the client directory
