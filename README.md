# skribbl.ai
Currently developing a variant to skribbl.io where rather than using a mouse to play the drawing game, you would instead use your finger and webcam to draw. Front-end is being developed using React and back-end is being developed using Express and Node. FTP requests are being made using socket.io. Has a Login page at the moment.

## How to start

1. Use `npm install` in both the client directory as well as the server directory
2. Use `npm start` in the client directory
